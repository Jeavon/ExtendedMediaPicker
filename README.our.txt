About

Extended Media Picker is a replacement for the Umbraco 7 built-in Media Picker. 
It offers the editor a link to the selected node in the Media section and has a 
slightly bigger thumbnail size. It also displays the Media node name. 

This package adds a custom Property Editor called "Extended Media Picker" and a 
new Data Type "Extended Media Picker" based on the Property Editor.

The Property Editor is based on the built-in Media Picker in Umbraco 7.1.4 and
should be able to replace it, however there are not enough testing done yet.

ExtendedMediaPicker
===================

An extended media picker for Umbraco 7 with whole picked image visible, plus name and a link to the media section.

Just copy to the ~/App_Plugins folder and restart the Application Pool. You should be able to see the new editor in Developer when creating a new Data Type. You can also replace the built-in Media Picker with Extended Media Picker as it stores the same data.
